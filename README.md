# RPMv3

## Getting Started
You need to have installed either python 2 or 3 with the following packages:
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	- scipy
Installing a scientific python such as anaconda should give you all the packages that 
you will need


##Running the tests

#To Do
```

```
You have a general class that is referred to as the RPM_ASI which 




##List of functions:

#Lattice makers:
	- Square
	- Tilted square
	- Kagome
	- Short shakti
	- Long shakti
	- Tetris

#Plotting functions
    - graph: Plots a quiver graph that shows the Coercive field, counts and vertex state
    - Graph charge: Plots a quiver with the charge of the vertex for kagome and tetris
    - Correlation: Plots the local corration between spins based on the surrounding microstates
    - Field Plot: Plots the local field at each point on the lattice and vertex. Colour is 
                proportional to the strength of the field
    - Vertex Type: Plots the vertex type for a square lattice
    - Animation: Can give a field sweep field and it will display an animation of 
                how the bars flip over the field sweep
